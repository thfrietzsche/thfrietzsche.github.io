	<p> When presenting media to people it is important to understand the audience you are trying to convey information to. Knowing your audience makes all the difference in what information you present and more importantly how you present. Depending on your audience you will want to use a different technical format so that the audience's presentation can match their skill sets and what they understand and know best. For example a graphic designer would be looking at how someone views something moreso than a techy who would like to see the code so that they can mold and change it on the fly. This versatility in the way information is presented is vital when trying to convey a message or idea to a group of people especially in professional formats.

	When you think about an audience you sometimes have to think about the medium that is best to use. For example when presenting information to a media executive who just wants the information and affiliated pictures in a easy to digest format, for this you would use a presentation such as <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a> to be able to get all the information added to the slides so that the executive can look at clean looking slides. This is why it is important to think of whom the information is for because it changes how it is presented. For this media exec. example you would use reveal.js to present the storyboard and concept art so that you can help the executive visualize the overall image and story. In this way it is a very useful tool to present information.

		For another example in regards to thinking about the different audiences we would present information to we can think about the example of the "techy" type. For people more technologically inclined information can be presented in the form of a html doc, or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupytr notebook.</a> More commonly in a notebook of somekind (digital not physical) the information would be presented so that the coders or what have you can edit and mess around with the code and really have the ability to be hands on with the code and to manipulate it in whatever way they want. This can be useful for groups that collaborate on projects by working on multiple different parts of the same code. In this way it is not only informative, but able to be more educational as the users/audience is able to interact with the work.

	<p> Broadening the perspective a bit we can think about a more widespread audience, the average user. Thinking about how one would create information to spread to the average person you could use an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp">HTML website</a> to create a site that spreads a message while also informing the user with different attractions to keep them engaged. For an example of the attractions you could have different tabs on the website to make it feel more explorable or you could have imagery, hyperlinks, and other forms of media on the site. Making an HTML website is acessible to the average user as well because it is accessible to anyone who has an internet connection allowing for your site to gain traction online as well.
