<h2>Spoilers for Cowboy Bebop </h2>
<p>In Cowboy Bebop the Journey is more important the final destination and has many elements that we can partake in our own lives. The story of the anime Cowboy Bebop is full of adventure as it follows the its main character Spike Spiegel through the vast possibilities of space in the year 2071. The show moves with the adventures with each episode starting a conflict and finishing it within the episode with some 2-part episode exceptions. When watching you get to join the cast as they go on wacky adventures as where we can see them interact in diverse environments as well as learn more about the characters themselves as we go into each characters past to learn about what brought them to the rag-tag group that we have now. It's as they say, it's not about the destination but the journey. What I mean by that is that Cowboy Bebop's beauty comes in the small moments in between the moments of plot along the way.</p>

<p>While watching Cowboyu Bebop you feel like a cowboy and adventurer along the way watching these characters that you grow to love interact according their personalities as well as their key set of skills. However, in these moments when it would seem very straight forward the show is filled with moments where we can reflect on the "humanity" of the characters and their own morals, ideologies, and asperations, to see their perspective on not just the problems in the show but rather in life. Spike the main character is when closer inspected a truly sad character as he has had to life a double life without his lover whom he cares about more than anyone in the world and we can come to see that Spike is really someone wearing a mask and putting up a front to his crew. Spike puts himself in danger most of the time not because he is a thrill seeking junky or to move the plot because he is some hero. (He is a stud) Spike jumps into danger because he is ultimately looking for a place where he can find death the entire series which ultimately leads to the climax of the show. The final scene in the show we see for Spike is his death which ultimately is saddening for the watcher as we could see the last few episodes when the entire team of bounty hunters that had assembled practically split up as if to resemble the impression that people don't stay in each other's lives forever. Spike went to finish business that he had ultimately been running away from for years and where he truthfully should have died originally but understandably he goes on to live an adventurous life while still feeling like there is something that he should do and attend to. Spike dying is sad and understandably makes one see that the story is over but at the same time the viewer can reflect on the journey that Spike and the others have had thus far and all the little bright moments that they had shared with one another.</p>

<p>Cowboy Bebop can be a reflection of life as crazy as the plot seems to be as we can look deeper into our own personal lives and grow to appreciate the smaller moments in the journey we are living in our own lives. We are all moving towards something but if we focus solely on that that moment in front of us and not the moment we have presently we wont be able to truly meet our destination without truthfully experiencing the journey that we are on in this very moment. Cowboy Bebop is a sign to appreciate the now, and the moment that we have before us as eventually it will slip by never to be caught again. It's not a sad story but one can look at it with a sad perspective, Cowboy Bebop tells us to appreciate the now and celebrate the adventure that is life regardless of the situation because in the end we can reflect on the journey that it has been and the lives that have been impacted on the way to the destination. Cowboy Bebop reflects on all the lives that Spike has impacted along his adventures and how they ultimately were seen for one episode at the most they still felt the impact from Spike's kindness as he was on his journey in life. Never to meet again but still feeling the kindness from yesterday. That is what Cowboy Bebop is all about, you can see it as a retrospective and reflect on the journey because that is what makes the ending good, being able to reflect on the point that got us this far and the feelings that we have felt along the way.</p>
