<p>With the recent step into the limelight of “for the people stocks” and cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-mania-is-focus-of-federal-probes-into-possible-manipulation-11613066950">Gamestop</a> stock and <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>, the idea of social unification online has come into question and people’s thoughts on limitations and potential risks that it could carry with it. People are wondering the repercussions and dangers of greater unification at a massive scale like this as well as potential dangers it has to investors who have millions invested in stocks and hedge funds. Ultimately however this is no real threat or is it any different that what most hedge fund companies do it’s just the people are creating the value by providing interest and as such making it so the people gain value from the stock going up. </p>
<p> There shouldn’t be regulations on people working in collaboration to give value and interest in products. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">R/Wallstreetbets<a/> did this through collaboration with thousands of people which is the same as thousands of people finding value in a stock such as Tesla independently and going to assign value in it through interest. There isn’t any foul play being conducted and it’s making many people get money and flip to solve problems financially that they may have been experiencing due to the pandemic. Social unification should be unlimited and regulated because it is a movement of people coming together just as a hedge company would when shorting a company like they were doing to gamestop. The people and greater populus just got to buying the stock just as the hedge funds would and they are upset because instead of them controlling the market it is done by the general public. </p>
<p> The Hedge funds lost money because they were trying to make money in a capitalist market. Since it is a capitalist market its free reign to everyone and free to the people, some people invest some don’t and the option is up to them. The hedge funds are a part of the market just as everyone else who chooses to be and they are capable of suffering losses just as the people are which is fair in a free market, however as the hedge funds make up a large portion of the market they make it swayed and as such make it so that they have a swayed or biased market portion and assume a sense of power in the market. Clearly this is biased towards the hedge funds and they are complaining about losing money in a free market. A free market is what the staples of American society and people coming together to assume an identity within the market are fair game in a free market as it’s the same tactics the hedge funds pull. When this picture is inspected closer we can see that the hedge funds are complaining	losing money in a free market that everyone has the freedom to invest and allocate their funds on their own accord. </p>
<p> Limiting a free market would be limiting the people and creating more segregation and adversity to get in what is supposed to be a free market. To create restrictions on the people is to restrict people from having the freedom of a public and open market for all. If there is a restriction on one’s freedom it goes against human rights as well as the rights of what it means to be an American. A free market isn’t free if people aren’t allowed to act within their own accord just as it is true that if a penalty for a law is a fine, then that law is only for the lower class. People are free to do whatever they want with their money just as our ancestors did and our children will. Freedom of choice and freedom of their markets. </p>
